# Page Syntax

Titles use a sequence of up to 6 consecutive `#` characters at the start. The
number of `#` characters denotes their heading level. After the `#` characters
there's a mandatory space before the title.

Only the page's title can have a single `#` character. Any page's section title
must start with at least 2 `#` characters.


## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by an empty line.
Contiguous lines are not broken,
instead they are joined into the same
paragraph by a space. Sequences   of consecutive    
   space characters are normalized to a single one.  

\# A paragraph can start with `#` if its prefixed with \code{\}.

\#### Only one \code{\} character is necessary to escape a sequence of `#`.

Escaping of # characters ## is ### only #### necessary ##### at ###### the
start of paragraphs. This escaping isn't necessary in titles either, the space
character after the sequence of `#` characters separates the title marker from
the title itself, see \note{# Page Title With #Hash Characters}.
