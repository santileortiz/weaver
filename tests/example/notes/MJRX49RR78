# Redacting

Redacting is the mechanism used to separate personal from public content. It
hides personal content in public publishing, but preserves useful relationships
for personal use.

This is an example of a block that only shows when publishing privately.
^personal

This paragraph contains a parenthesized reference (like this \note{Non-public})
to a private page. The redacting feature will remove the parenthesis and its
enclosing content when publishing publicly.

To make redacting undetectable when publishing publicly, we do some space
stripping. Spaces \i{after}(the redacted parenthesis \note{Non-public})          are
preserved, but we remove spaces \i{before}     (the redacted parenthesis \note{Non-public}).
As in most places, multiple spaces will be collapsed to a single one.

Redacting also works with virtual entities (like \personal{Non-public Virtual}).

(non redacted parenthesis before) (and a redacted one \note{Non-public})

(starting redacted parenthesis \note{Non-public}) (with non redacted parenthesis after)

Stress ((d((d(d))s)(a))(d)) (((d((d(d))s)(a))(d)) \note{Non-public} ((d((d(d))s)(a))(d))) ((d((d(d))s)(a))(d))
