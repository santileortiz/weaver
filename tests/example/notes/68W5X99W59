# Sample PKB

This is a small personal knowledge base that tests features beyond TSPLX/PSPLX
syntax parsing and HTML generation.

In this environment we can test for example the difference between local and
public site generations, linking between pages, data
(consolidation/navigation/visualization), file references etc.

Tested features

 - \note{Page Syntax}
 - \note{Page Links}
 - \note{Redacting}
 - \note{Virtual List}
